### About
This is a modified version of [pk3ds](https://github.com/kwsch/pk3DS) to be more compatible with Linux. 

So far it consists of the following ~~hacks~~ changes:
- Drag and Drop in Tools Unpack menu is replaced with Click -> File prompts
- Personal data window size is forced to be larger

Linux usage tips:
- using [monodevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/download/linux/) saved a lot of headaches and "just worked" to compile and open the project
- [dump decrypted .3ds rom](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/Dumping-Game-Cartridges#decrypt9wip) from a hacked 3ds console
- [ihaveamac's tutorial](https://github.com/ihaveamac/3DS-rom-tools/wiki/Extract-a-game-or-application-in-.3ds-or-.cci-format) gets the romfs and exefs out of the dumped .3ds file. A folder containing these folders is what should be opened in pk3ds.
